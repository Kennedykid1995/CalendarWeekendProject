# Calendar Project Objectives

- Use the skills learned on the todo list app add a task and delete a task and implement this ability on each day of the week in a month. 

    - Each day should have the ability to add a task as well as see the current task listed.  

    - Upon clicking on a task, you should be able to mark it as done. This should be seen with a line through the task. A button should be available to clear the task that has been completed.
    
    - Has the ability to have multiple different pictures so a carousel will be used to display this effect above the days/weeks of the month and just underneath the month.

## Advanced ideas and features

- Saving the task on localhost so that refresh allows the data to remain saved. 

- A search bar to the left of the calendar that allows for the searching of the task and displays the dates on the sidebar where that task shows up. 

- If a task is not completed the ability to double click and shift the task to the next day.  On double click would highlight (in red) the task and then a button would shift that task to the next day. This could be difficult as it was not demonstrated this week but can push for mastery of using React.

- Use moment.js to format the dates for the month to match the day of the week it should be in life. Also add other months. 

- Add functionality so that you can click to different months and also have the same features.
