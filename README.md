# Lambda Week 7 Recap Calendar Project

#### Build a calendar that will also have the ability to create a task on each day of the week in the month.

#### *This is a Project I built to recap Week 7 at Lambda School*.

## Objectives

- Use the skills learned on the todo list app in order to add a task and delete a task and implement this ability on each day of the week in a month.

    - Each day should have the ability to add a task as well as see the current task listed.

    - Upon clicking on a task, you should be able to mark it as done. This should be seen with a line through the task. A button should be available to clear the task that has been completed.

    - Has the ability to have multiple different pictures so a carousel will be used to display this effect above the days/weeks of the month and just underneath the Month.

The clear completed and mark shift spots in the design would be the buttons to clear and shift.     
Previous month and next month will also be clickable to change the month to make a full calendar and not just one month.

As this can be a lot, the objective is to use the skills learned this week to design a *one month calendar*.    
Developing an algorithm to get every day of the year and moving forward would be a good idea for a portfolio/resume-piece, but this weekend's objectives are repetition and review. 


## Advanced ideas and features

- Saving the task on localhost so that refresh allows the data to remain saved. A search bar to the left of the calendar that allows for the searching of the task and displays the dates on the sidebar where that task shows up.

- If a task is not completed the ability to double click and shift the task to the next day. On double click would highlight (in red) the task and then a button would shift that task to the next day. This could be difficult as it was not demonstrated this week but can push for mastery of using React.

- Use moment.js to format the dates for the month to match the day of the week it should be in life. Also add other months.

- Add functionality so that you can click to different months and also have the same features.
